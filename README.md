# install & run

after doing a normal ```npm install```, we need to do an additional ```npm install next@canary``` since we need the canary version to be able to use Partial Pre Rendering (PPR) at the moment. (9.12.2024)
```
git clone https://github.com/ekinakkaya/yc_directory.git
cd yc_directory
npm install
npm install next@canary
```
